## Contributing Guidelines
There are no specific guidelines for contributing, apart from a few general guidelines we tried to follow, such as:
* Code should follow PEP8 standards as closely as possible

If you see something that could be improved, send a pull request! 
We are always happy to look at improvements, to ensure that `chomskIE`, as a project, is the best version of itself.
